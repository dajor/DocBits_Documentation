# DocFlow MCP

DocFlow exposes a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that lets AI assistants manage workflows and partner cards programmatically. Any MCP-compatible client — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Codex, or custom integrations — can connect and use these tools.

## What Can You Do?

With DocFlow MCP you can:

- **List, create, update, and delete** advanced workflows
- **Test workflows** with real or mock documents
- **Build custom cards** using the Partner Card SDK
- **Validate, test, approve, and manage** partner card submissions
- **Import cards** directly from GitHub repositories
